# Gamedev.js 2024 Bonus Challenges

OP Games is always on the lookout for awesome game developers who want to build games using the latest tech. We also strive to give these games an opportunity to be discovered by publishing them on our distribution platform, [Arcadia.fun](https://arcadia.fun).

The two bonus challenges will allow you to play around with some of our generative AI and blockchain tools, and completing them will go a long way in getting your game published on Arcadia. 

Join other esteemed Gamedev.js / JS13k winners as published Arcadia developers, such as: 

* [Flip Flop by Feature Kreep](https://arcadia.fun/games/cbf0b879-1f68-4b38-8693-a302195c3937/),
* [Blaze Racing by Happylander](https://arcadia.fun/games/89686bd2-cbe8-4d46-863f-8db2532a0759/), and
