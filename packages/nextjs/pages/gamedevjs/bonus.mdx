The two bonus challenges below will allow you to play around with some of our generative AI and blockchain tools, and hopefully give you some inspiration for the NPC challenge. Completing them will also go a long way in getting your game published on Arcadia.

Good luck, we look forward to your submissions!

# Bonus Challenge: Spark

#### Difficulty: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

To complete this challenge, your game must use the Spark APIs in your game.

[Spark](https://dev.spark.arcadia.fun/) is our bleeding-edge generative AI tool that allows developers to turn NFTs into NPCs, giving them generative AI capabilities such as image-to-video, chat and more.

You can then use the API key to access the Spark APIs, which are [documented here üëà](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21168270/2sA35Ea3Zy#f24567de-5fb7-4e42-8bf0-079255ada02a)

You will need to be the owner of an NFT collection to use Spark. If it's your first time working with NFTs, this Speedrun Ethereum challenge is a great way to get started: [Speedrun Ethereum](https://speedrunethereum.com/challenge/simple-nft-example)

üõëüöß Please note that Spark is in very, very early-access. Beware, here be dragons üêâ 
We will be updating this section with more tools to help you mint your own NFT collections and improve the API documentation soon üößüõë
