# NPC Challenge by OP Games

As part of the Gamedev.js Jam 2024 we're introducing a special challenge by OP Games - the [NPC Challenge](https://gamedevjs.com/jam/2024/#challenge-opgames). 

### Description

The goal is to **create a game that makes use of NPCs in a way that hasn't been seen before in most games.** 

Non-player characters (NPCs) have mostly been used as side characters, companions, quest givers, or enemies in games. But do they have to be limited to these roles? Now that we have the affordances of new technologies such as generative AI and blockchain, we should start to re-imagine the role of NPCs in our games.

To be considered for this challenge, your game must simply make use of NPCs. To win the challenge, your game must make use of NPCs in a thoughtful and innovative way. Subvert the traditional roles of NPCs in games and show us something new!
